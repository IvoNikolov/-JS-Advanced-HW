The Rain - DMX

It's such a long, long train ride
It's such a long lonely ride back home

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know
So to me it ain't nothing but being true
But..

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain

It doesn't have to be the way it is
You say it is
Just because for the past 20 years
Everyday it is (WhAt?)

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
